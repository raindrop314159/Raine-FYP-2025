# Raine-FYP-2025
This is the repository to store MATLAB codes written by I, Raine Chang for my Final Year Project in the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) on the topic of Air Quality Exposure Measurements and Modelling: Personal exposure measurements and analysis following different individuals as they go about

Special thanks goes to my FYP supervisor - Professor Alexis LAU and co-supervisor - Professor Jimmy Chan, as well as our post-doctor Comet for their guidance and support which led to the formation of the codes in this repository.
